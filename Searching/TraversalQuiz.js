//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
breadth first search
//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
BFS (dfs will take long)
//If the tree is very wide:
depth first search (bfs will need too much memory)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
depth first search

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
depth first search 

//Finding the shortest path:
breadth first search
